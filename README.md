# Busting Jagron for AI

```A lot of confusing terms are around us all the time, specially if a new person is trying to get into this field of Data.

By the End of this Article you'll be able to classify things happening around in a better fashion as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science, Pattern Recognition and so on.

## What is the Jagron Bubble floating around in AI ?

All of us have come along these definitions where people quote Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Machine Learning etc normally and we get confused by what the person really means.

For example
  1. Courses on **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**
  2. Introduction to **Pattern Recognition** and **Machine Learning**
  3. **Deep Learning** for **Natural Language Processing**
  4. **Image Processing** for **Computer Vision**
  5. Deep **Reinforcement Learning**
  
  
After hearing these terms one with another let's jump to some of the definitions and try to see if it helps to clear this jargon.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.


### Machine Learning
is a field of computer science that uses _statistical techniques_ to give computer systems the ability to _"learn"_ with _data_, and _without being explicitly programmed_.


### Data Science
is an _interdisciplinary_ field that uses _scientific methods, processes, algorithms_ and systems to extract _knowledge_ and insights from data in various forms, _both structured and unstructured_,  similar to data mining.


### Pattern Recognition
is the automated _recognition of patterns_ and regularities _in data_.


### Computer Vision
is an _interdisciplinary field_ that deals with how computers can be made to gain _high-level understanding_ from digital _images or videos_ and _automate tasks that the human visual system_ can do.


### Deep Learning
is a new area of _Machine Learning research_, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: _Artificial Intelligence_.
