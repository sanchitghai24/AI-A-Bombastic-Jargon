# Busting Jagron for AI
'''markdown
A lot of confusing terms are around us all the time, specially if a new person is trying to get into this field of Data.

By the End of this Article you'll be able to classify things happening around in a better fashion as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science, Pattern Recognition and so on.

## What is the Jagron Bubble floating around in AI ?

All of us have come along these definitions where people quote Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Machine Learning etc normally and we get confused by what the person really means.

For example
  1. Courses on **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**
  2. Introduction to **Pattern Recognition** and **Machine Learning**
  3. **Deep Learning** for **Natural Language Processing**
  4. **Image Processing** for **Computer Vision**
  5. Deep **Reinforcement Learning**
  
  
After hearing these terms one with another let's jump to some of the definitions and try to see if it helps to clear this jargon.

### Artificial Intelligence

**Artificial intelligence (AI)**, sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.


### Machine Learning

**Machine learning** is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" with data, and without being explicitly programmed.


### Data Science

**Data science** is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured,  similar to data mining.


### Pattern Recognition

**Pattern recognition** is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data.


### Computer Vision

**Computer vision** is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.


### Deep Learning

**Deep Learning** is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: Artificial Intelligence.
